## Week 7
### 31/03/20 Tuesday
- Continued to work on setting up the automation framework, incorparted a simple test for verifying home page

### 1/4/20 Wednesday
- Started investigating deploying backend site to Heroku
- Used custom buildpacks for nodejs and modified the scripts in our package.json to work properly

### 3/4/20 Friday
- Finalised the build process for Heroku
- Heroku automatically builds each PR as a preview and also tracks the master branch for a 'production version'

### 4/4/20 Saturday
- Finalised a build process for Netlify to track the frontend
- Builds each PR/tracks a master version

### 4/4/20 Sunday
- Created a system that lets the backend site serve a preview of the frontend app (express serving React)
- This allows the builds on the PRs to be fully useable (under the previous system each frontend PR would still be linked to a stale master version of the backend)
